    * FULL access -- to the -- native platform
  * characteristics

        * MORE predictable
        * easier to debug
    * **Component-Based.**
      * components -- manage -- their state
      * complex UIs == SEVERAL components
    * **Developer Velocity.**
      * == local changes effective in seconds
      * changes to JS code can be live reloaded / WITHOUT rebuilding the native app
    * **Portability.**
      * reuse code | iOS, Android, and [other platforms](https://reactnative.dev/docs/out-of-tree-platforms)
